<h2>Purpose:</h2>
    
<p> The purpose of this activity was to build an fully functional day planner. The planner had to allow the time and date to your local computer. Doing so allowed the planner to judge whether the event was past, present, or furture also providing color for visual aid. Finally the user had to be able to add events to the day planner and save them using local storage so when the page was refreshed they would still exist on their computer. </p>

<h2>Task List:</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Deploy a Functional Webpage </li>
    <li> Provide the user with the ability to add events to the planner </li>
    <li> On the back end provide current date/time sync from local computer to the webpage</li>
    <li> Provide the user the ability to save the events to the planner (local storage)</li>
    <li> Provide colored rows to visually aid in events that have occured and are to come</li>
    <li> Provide clean and fuctional code using jQuery</li>
</ol>

<h4>Looking Forward: </h4>

<p> Looking forward I would like to continue updating this day planner. I would like to see about the possiblity of extending it out into a monthly planner. Also I would like to find a way for the events to auto save as the user is typing them in so you dont have to remember to click the save button. Lastly as always any suggestions to make your user experience better are always welcome so please feel free to let me know.
