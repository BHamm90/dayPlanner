<h2>Purpose:</h2>
    
<p> The purpose of this activity was to build an fully functional day planner. The planner had to allow the time and date to your local computer. Doing so allowed the planner to judge whether the event was past, present, or furture also providing color for visual aid. Finally the user had to be able to add events to the day planner and save them using local storage so when the page was refreshed they would still exist on their computer. </p>

<h2>Task List:</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Deploy a Functional Webpage </li>
    <li> Provide the user with the ability to add events to the planner </li>
    <li> On the back end provide current date/time sync from local computer to the webpage</li>
    <li> Provide the user the ability to save the events to the planner (local storage)</li>
    <li> Provide colored rows to visually aid in events that have occured and are to come</li>
    <li> Provide clean and fuctional code using jQuery</li>
</ol>

<h4>Looking Forward: </h4>

<p> Looking forward I would like to continue updating this code quiz wih more question from the criteria we learn in the future. Also I would like to create multiple test that can be assessed from one page depending on what you would like to study or were you are at in the class. Finally I would love to hear other idea from the users on what they would like to see added.
